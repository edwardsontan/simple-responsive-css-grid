[Creatix CSS](http://www.creatix.org/creatix-css/) is by Karin Soika and Ralph Soika. They've made [their stylesheets](https://github.com/laluluny/creatix-css/) available on a Creative Commons Share Alike license [CC BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

## Features ##
* All columns widths are specified as percentages.
* Multi-column layout automatically changes to a single column for small viewport devices and resized broswers on desktops.
* Coded in SCSS with gutter margin defined as a variable and is therefore adjustable to suit page/site requirements.

## Requirements ##
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) compiler is necessary to create the CSS. (I use [Koala](http://koala-app.com/).)

## Procedure ##
Download normalize.css into css folder/directory. Compile scss file and import normalize.css and any other css files and then minify the combined css. [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) does the scss compilation, import of external files, and css minfication automatically when configured correctly.
